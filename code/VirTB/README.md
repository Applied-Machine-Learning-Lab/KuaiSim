# VirtualTaobao-Imp

## 1. Purpose
This project aims to implement algorithms proposed in paper:
> Jing-Cheng Shi, Yang Yu, Qing Da, Shi-Yong Chen, and An-Xiang Zeng. [Virtual-Taobao: Virtualizing real-world online retail environment for reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10000). In: Proceedings of the 33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAIâ€™19), Honolulu, HI, 2019. 

## 2. Efforts
Our woks mainly invovles:
1. Build virtual environment by real data collected from Taobao;
2. Implement and train GAN-SD(GAN for Simulating Distribution) for generating high dimension customer feature;
3. Implement and train MAIL(MultiAgent Adversarial Imitation Learning) for generating generalizable customer actions.


## 3. Details
1. We building our environment using data from [VirtualTaobao](https://github.com/eyounx/VirtualTaobao), which is the original implementation of the paper.As you can find that details about how to build the model and steps to train the model are missing,We hope this project will provide you some insights.

2. To be added....
